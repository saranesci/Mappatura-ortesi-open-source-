# Arthritis Typing Aid
The Arthritis Typing Aid is a ball stylus that allows users with arthritis to type without pain. This device is intended for users with arthritis that have difficulty typing due to joint pain. The ball of the device provides an easy grip, while the stylus allows for the user to type.

The Arthritis Typing Aid was designed by Alec Stilwell and published on [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-arthritis-typing-aid-77579).
